# ionic1-exercise

Run: 

$ ionic serve



Issues:

1. Due to CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) I can't make a get request from the url provided, that's why I'm using Json data in services for the User details and for the Location.

2. Mapbox directions-> there is not enought documentation for Angularjs (https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#directions)
